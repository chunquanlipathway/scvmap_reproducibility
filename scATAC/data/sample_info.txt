Here we present a massively parallel droplet-based platform for mapping transposase-accessible chromatin in tens of thousands of single cells per sample (scATAC-seq). We obtain and analyze chromatin profiles of over 200,000 single cells in two primary human systems. In blood, scATAC-seq allows marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity, and reconstruction of trajectories of differentiation from progenitors to diverse and rare immune cell types. In basal cell carcinoma, scATAC-seq reveals regulatory landscapes of malignant, stromal, and immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, scATAC-seq of serial tumor biopsies before and after PD-1 blockade allows identification of chromatin regulators and differentiation trajectories of therapy-responsive intratumoral T cell subsets, revealing a shared regulatory program driving CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development in association with clinical response. We anticipate that droplet-based single-cell chromatin accessibility will provide a broadly applicable means of identifying regulatory factors and elements that underlie cell type and function.	scATAC-Ref	https://bio.liclab.net/scATAC-Ref/browseDetail?sample=GSE129785_TME_All	data	0	36721	20	0	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)_skin

Here, we present a multi-omic single-nucleus study of 191,890 nuclei in late-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD), accessible through our intuitive web portal, profiling chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological samples and uncovering vast cellular heterogeneity. We identified cell-type specific, disease-associated candidate cis-regulatory elements and their candidate target genes, including an oligodendrocyte-associated regulatory module containing links to APOE and CLU. We describe cis-regulatory relationships in specific cell-types at AD risk loci defined by genome wide association studies (GWAS), demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic single-nucleus approach. Trajectory analysis of glial populations identified disease-relevant transcription factors, like SREBF1 and their regulatory targets. Further, we introduce scWGCNA, a co-expression network analysis strategy robust to the sparsity of single-cell data, to perform a systems-level meta-analysis of AD transcriptomics.	scATAC-Ref	https://bio.liclab.net/scATAC-Ref/browseDetail?sample=GSE174367	data	0	7079	7	19	Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Frontal Cortex_brain_1

Here, we map, at the single-cell level, the chromatin landscape of immune cells from blood, normal adjacent kidney, and malignant tissue from patients with early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Specifically in T cells, we catalogue the various cell states dictated by tissue- and developmental stage-specific chromatin accessibility patterns and we infer key chromatin regulators of these states. In the CD8+ T cells progression to dysfunction, we observe an extensive rewiring of the regulatory networks. Unexpectedly, we find that among the transcription factors that orchestrate the path to dysfunction, NFkB, a transcription factor with an established prosurvival role during TCR-mediated activation, is associated with a proapoptotic program in late stages of dysfunction in ccRCC infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Importantly, the epigenomic profiling can stratify RCC patients based on a NFkB-driven proapoptotic signature which was also validated at the gene expression and protein level. Our study provides a rich resource for understanding the functional states and regulatory dynamics of immune cells in RCC.	scATAC-Ref	https://bio.liclab.net/scATAC-Ref/browseDetail?sample=GSE181062	data	0	18123	12	20	Early Stage ccRCC_PBMC

The progenitor state is linked to coordinate upregulation of proliferation genes through chromatin opening at nearby lineage-specific enhancers. Mutant Kras taps into this program by co-opting the normally transient enhancer elements, making them permanent and Kras-dependent in cancer.

Most approaches in this area rely on oligonucleotide barcode-conjugated antibodies that target cell surface epitopes of interest, enabling their concomitant detection with the transcriptome. However, a similar high-throughput measurement of other cellular modalities such as the epigenome in concert with protein levels have not been described. Moreover, detection of epitopes is limited to antigens for which a specific antibody is available. Here, we introduce PHAGE-ATAC, an approach that enables the scalable and simultaneous detection of protein levels and chromatin accessibility data in single cells using the assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). Quantitative detection of proteins by PHAGE-ATAC is accomplished through the use of engineerable nanobody-displaying phages that are genetically barcoded within the nanobody-encoding phagemids.

Assaying transposase-accessible chromatin in single cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a suitable method for revealing such networks. Thus, scATAC-seq was applied to define the landscape of active regulatory DNA in AS. As a result, there was a significant change in the percent of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs, and 37 differentially accessible transcription factor (TF) motifs were identified. T cells, monocytes-1 and dendritic cells were found to be crucial for the IL-17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway, since they had 73 potential target genes regulated by 8 TF motifs with decreased accessibility in AS. Moreover, natural killer cells were involved in AS by increasing the accessibility to TF motifs TEAD1 and JUN to induce cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. In addition, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells may be vital for altering host immune functions through increasing the accessibility of TF motifs NR1H4 and OLIG (OLIGI and OLIG2), respectively. These results explain clear gene regulatory variation in PBMCs from AS patients, providing a foundational framework for the study of personal regulomes and delivering insights into epigenetic therapy.	scBlood	https://bio.liclab.net/scBlood/detail1?sampleId=scBlood_h_324	counts	1	2239	6	47	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Healthy controls_PBMC

This dataset was generated using mtscATAC-seq to track mitochondrial mutations in peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymph node from 9 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) across different clinical scenarios. Our in-depth analysis reveals different patterns of dynamisms in mitochondrial mutations in patients undergoing watchful waiting, chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), allogeneic stem cell transplantation, ibrutinib treatment or transformation to Richter’s syndrome.

We discovered that P300/CBP inhibition dynamically perturbs acetylation kinetics and dramatically suppresses core-transcriptional networks in the absence of changes to chromatin accessibility. CRISPR/Cas9 screening identified NCOR1 and HDAC3 transcriptional co-repressors as the principle antagonists of P300/CBP by counteracting acetylation turnover kinetics. Finally, deacetylation of H3K27 provides nucleation sites for reciprocal methylation switching, a feature that can be exploited therapeutically by concomitant KDM6A and P300 inhibition. Overall, this study indicates that the steady-state histone acetylation-methylation equilibrium functions as a molecular rheostat governing cellular transcription that is amenable to therapeutic exploitation as an anti-cancer regimen.	scBlood	https://bio.liclab.net/scBlood/detail1?sampleId=scBlood_h_334	counts	1	4030	4	81	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)_2_PBMC

We identified a number of candidate mechanisms for smooth muscle cell transition states and identified putative binding sites for risk variants.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 170 loci associated with CAD, where the majority of risk variants reside in noncoding DNA sequences impacting cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Here, we applied single-cell ATAC-seq to profile 28,316 cells across coronary artery segments from 41 patients with varying stages of CAD, which revealed 14 distinct cellular clusters. We mapped ~320,000 accessible sites across all cells, identified cell type-specific elements, transcription factors, and prioritized functional CAD risk variants via quantitative trait locus and sequence-based predictive modeling. We identified a number of candidate mechanisms for smooth muscle cell transition states and identified putative binding sites for risk variants.

Here, we investigated whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic patterns that align with patient outcomes. Methods: We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4hr, 24hr, 72hr post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness. Findings: Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery], p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085, n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression).

EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery], p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085, n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression). Interpretation: The inclusion of gene expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification in acute critical illnesses.

Assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with single-cell sequencing (scATAC-seq) contribute to the progress in epigenetic studies. However, the impact of epigenetic technology on autoimmune diseases has not been objectively analyzed. Therefore, scATAC-seq was performed to generate a high-resolution map of accessible loci in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RA patients at the single-cell level. The purpose of our project was to discover the transcription factors (TFs) that were involved in the pathogenesis of RA at single-cell resolution. In our research, we obtained 22 accessible chromatin patterns. Then, 10 key TFs were involved in the RA pathogenesis by regulating the activity of MAP kinase. Consequently, two genes (PTPRC, SPAG9) regulated by 10 key TFs were found that may be associated with RA disease pathogenesis and these TFs were obviously enriched in RA patients (p<0.05, FC>1.2). With further qPCR validation on PTPRC and SPAG9 in monocytes, we found differential expression of these two genes, which were regulated by eight TFs (ZNF384, HNF1B, DMRTA2, MEF2A, NFE2L1, CREB3L4 (var. 2), FOSL2::JUNB (var. 2), MEF2B). What is more, the eight TFs showed highly accessible binding sites in RA patients. These findings demonstrate the value of using scATAC-seq to reveal transcriptional regulatory variation in RA-derived PBMCs, providing insights on therapy from an epigenetic perspective.	scBlood	https://bio.liclab.net/scBlood/detail1?sampleId=scBlood_h_337	counts	1	2409	5	130	PBMC Rheumatoid arthritis_1

sample_id_139	GSE203567	hg38	GSM6176366	GSM6176366	-	Human	Blood	scATAC-seq	Normal	Umbilical Cord Blood mononuclear cells	When human cord blood derived CD34+ cells are induced to differentiate, they undergo rapid and dynamic morphological and molecular transformations that are critical for fate commitment. In particular, the cells passe through a transitory phase known as “multilineage primed” state. These cells are characterized by a mixed gene expression profile, different in each cell, with the co-expression of many genes characteristic for concurrent cell lineages. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms of the establishment and the exit from this transitory state. We investigated this issue using single-cell RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq. Two phases were detected. The first phase is a rapid and global chromatin decompaction that makes most of the gene promoters in the genome accessible for transcription. It results 24h later in enhanced and pervasive transcription of the genome leading to the concomitant increase in the cell-to-cell variability of transcriptional profiles. The second phase is the exit from the multilineage-primed phase marked by a slow chromatin closure and a subsequent overall downregulation of gene transcription. This process is selective and results in the emergence of coherent expression profiles corresponding to distinct cell subpopulations. The typical time scale of these events spans 48 to 72 hours. These observations suggest that the non-specificity of genome decompaction is the condition for the generation of a highly variable multilineage expression profile. The non-specific phase is followed by specific regulatory actions that stabilize and maintain the activity of key genes, while the rest of the genome becomes repressed again by the chromatin re-compaction. Thus, the initiation of differentiation is reminiscent of a trial-and-error process that associates the spontaneous generation of gene expression diversity to subsequent regulatory actions that maintain the activity of some genes while the rest of the genome sinks back to the repressive closed chromatin state.	scBlood	https://bio.liclab.net/scBlood/detail1?sampleId=scBlood_h_175	counts	0	4948	9	138	Umbilical Cord Blood mononuclear cells_Blood
